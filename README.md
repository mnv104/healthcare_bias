Detect any biases in health care


# My observations so far
- The number of males to females in this data set is 207 to 96. So males are over-represented in this data set.
- Mean heart disease indicator for the males in this data set is 0.45, and for females it is 0.75. So the disease prevalance by gender is different.

- There is indeed a bias between each sex and a bias between young and old people. Males and old people are generally diagnosed with heart disease but don't have it or generally aren't diagnosed with heart disease and actually have it.
